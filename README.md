<!-- ![Sudoku Solver Banner](./images/sudoku_banner.png) (Add your own banner or a screenshot here!) -->

## ‚ú® Description

This project is an **Automatic Sudoku Solver** that uses advanced image processing to recognize and solve Sudoku puzzles from scanned or photographed images (**JPG, PNG, or BMP**).

-   **Detects** the Sudoku grid in the input image  
-   **Extracts** individual cells, applies custom thresholding, and uses template matching to recognize each digit  
-   **Solves** the Sudoku using a backtracking algorithm  
-   **Displays** the complete solution in a clean, readable digital format

## üéØ Input Constraints

> [!Tip]
>  For best results, make sure your input images follow these guidelines:

-   **Brightness:**  
  The image must **not be too dark** ‚Äì digits and grid lines should be clearly visible.

-   **Orientation:**  
  The Sudoku grid should **not be upside down or rotated**; keep it upright and aligned.

-   **Completeness:**  
  The grid should be **complete** and contain only **one Sudoku puzzle** per image.

-   **Digit Clarity:**  
  Digits should be **clear** and printed in a **standard font** (avoid handwriting or unusual styles).

## üöÄ High-Level Architecture

This project processes Sudoku images through the following main steps:

1.   **Input Image:** User selects a scanned or photographed Sudoku puzzle.
2.   **Preprocessing:** Convert to grayscale, blur, and threshold to enhance grid and digits.
3.   **Grid Detection:** Detect the Sudoku grid with edge detection and perspective correction.
4.   **Cell Segmentation:** Split the grid into 81 individual cell images.
5.   **Digit Recognition:** Clean, center, and compare each cell with digit templates.
6.   **Sudoku Solver:** Solve the grid using a backtracking algorithm.
7.   **Result Display:** Display the recognized and solved Sudoku digitally.

## ü™Å Implementation Steps

>### Step 1. Grid Detection & Localization
 

#### üîΩ Loading the Sudoku Image  
User selects a scanned or photographed Sudoku puzzle using a file dialog. The image is loaded and resized if needed for processing.

 
 

#### üåö Convert to Grayscale  
The input color image is converted to grayscale to simplify further processing.

![üåë Step 2 - Grayscale](./SS/step2_gray.png)

 

#### üü¶ Canny Edge Detection  
Detect strong edges, making grid lines stand out.

![üîé Step 3 - Canny Edges](./SS/step3_canny.png)

 

#### üîó Edge Linking  
Connect edge fragments for cleaner, continuous contours.

![üîó Step 4 - Edge Linking](./SS/step4_linked.png)

 
#### ‚ûï Dilation  
Expand and strengthen grid lines by dilating the edges.

![‚ûï Step 5 - Dilation](./SS/step5_dilate.png)

 

#### üé® Find All Contours  
Detect all possible closed shapes (contours) in the image.

![üåÄ Step 6 - Contours](./SS/step6_contours.png)
 

#### üî≤ Select Biggest Contour  
Find the largest 4-point contour, presumed to be the Sudoku grid.

![üî≤ Step 7 - Biggest Contour](./SS/step7_biggest.png)

 
#### ‚úÇÔ∏è Warp Sudoku  
Straighten and crop the grid to a perfect square using a perspective transform.

![üß© Step 8 - Warp Grid](./SS/step8_warped.png)


>### üî¢ Step 2. Divide Cells

 
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cell Segmentation  
After localizing and warping the Sudoku grid, the image is divided into **81 equal-sized cells** for digit recognition.

![1Ô∏è‚É£ Step - Cell Segmentation](./SS/step_cell_segmentation.png)
 

#### ‚ö´Ô∏è Cell Thresholding  
Convert each cell image to a clean **black-and-white (binary)** format, making digits stand out from the background.

![‚ö´Ô∏è Step - Cell Thresholding](./SS/step_cell_thresholding.png)

 

#### üßπ Border Removing  
Remove black grid lines or artifacts around the edges of each cell, ensuring only the digit remains for recognition.

![üßπ Step - Border Removing](./SS/step_border_removing.png)

 
#### üéØ Digit Centering  
Center the digit within the cell image to improve template matching accuracy.  
Templates used for comparison contain black digits that fill **80% of the image width**, ensuring consistent alignment and scale.

![üéØ Step - Digit Centering](./SS/step_digit_centering.png)

>### üîç Step 3. Digit Recognition

#### üè∑Ô∏è Template Matching

Identify which digit is present in each cell by comparing the processed cell image with a set of labeled reference images (**templates**) for each digit (1‚Äì9).

- For each cell, the algorithm compares its pixels to each digit template (same size, possibly different fonts).
- It counts how many black pixels overlap.
- The digit whose template has the highest overlap score (using the **Dice/F1 coefficient** for fairness) is selected as the recognized digit.

Templates used for comparison contain black digits that fill 80% of the image width. Recentering the image ensuring consistent alignment and scale.

**Algorithm Pseudocode:**
```c++
pixelMatchScore(cell_image, template_image):
    match_count = 0
    cell_black = 0
    template_black = 0
    for each pixel (y, x) in cell_image:
        if cell_image[y, x] is black and template_image[y, x] is black:
            match_count += 1
        if cell_image[y, x] is black:
            cell_black += 1
        if template_image[y, x] is black:
            template_black += 1
    score = 2 * match_count / (cell_black + template_black)
    return score
```

> ### üßÆ Step 4. Solving the Sudoku

The recognized grid is solved using a classic **backtracking algorithm**, which fills in the empty cells one by one and backtracks when a conflict is found, ensuring a valid and complete solution for the puzzle.

## üèÅ Results

The project was tested on multiple scanned and photographed Sudoku puzzles with different print qualities and fonts.

- For each input image, the program successfully localized the grid, recognized the digits, and displayed both the recognized and solved grids.
- Sample cases demonstrate **accurate digit extraction** and **robust solving**, even with minor noise or grid imperfections.

### üì¶ Instructions

1. **Prepare Templates:**  
   Place digit template images (`nr_1.png`, `nr_2.png`, ...) in a folder named `Digits` in your project directory.

2. **Prepare Input Images:**  
   Place your scanned or photographed Sudoku images in an `Images` folder.

3. **Start the Program:**  
   Run the executable or start from your IDE.

4. **Load a Sudoku Image:**  
   When prompted, select an image file from the `Images` folder using the file dialog.

5. **View Results:**  
   - The recognized grid and the solved Sudoku will be displayed in separate windows.
   - The recognized digits are shown in the console and as an image.

6. **Exit:**  
   Choose the exit option in the program menu or simply close the window.
 

> [!Tip]
>- For best results, use **clear, well-lit images** with the grid upright and digits readable.
>- Make sure the **template digit images match the font style** of your Sudoku puzzles.
